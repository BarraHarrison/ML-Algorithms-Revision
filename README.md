# Revision of Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains implementations and explanations of both Supervised and Unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented with practical examples to help understand how they work and when to use them.

## ðŸ”¹ Supervised Learning Algorithms

ðŸ”¹ AdaBoost Classifier â€“ An ensemble method that combines multiple weak classifiers (often decision trees) to create a strong classifier by focusing more on the difficult-to-classify samples.

ðŸ”¹ Decision Tree Classifier â€“ A model that splits data into subsets based on feature values, forming a tree-like structure. Each internal node represents a decision on a feature, while leaves represent outcomes.

ðŸ”¹ Gradient Boost Classifier â€“ An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, where each new model corrects the errors of the previous ones using gradient descent optimization.

ðŸ”¹ KNN Classifier â€“ A simple algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class among its nearest neighbors in the feature space.

ðŸ”¹ KNN Regression â€“ Similar to KNN Classification but used for regression tasks, predicting the value of a point based on the average of its nearest neighbors.

ðŸ”¹ Linear Regression â€“ A regression algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a straight line.

ðŸ”¹ Logistic Regression â€“ A classification algorithm that predicts probabilities using the logistic (sigmoid) function. Often used for binary classification tasks.

ðŸ”¹ Naive Bayes Classifier â€“ A probabilistic classifier based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem with an assumption of independence among features.

ðŸ”¹ Random Forest Classifier â€“ An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

ðŸ”¹ SVM Classifier â€“ A model that finds the hyperplane which best separates the data into different classes, maximizing the margin between classes.

## ðŸ”¹ Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

ðŸ”¹ DBSCAN Clustering â€“ A density-based clustering algorithm that groups points closely packed together while marking points in low-density regions as outliers.

ðŸ”¹ K-Means Clustering â€“ A clustering algorithm that partitions the dataset into k clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster.

ðŸ”¹ PCA Dimensionality Reduction â€“ A technique used to reduce the dimensionality of data by projecting it onto new axes (principal components) while retaining most of the variance.

This repository is designed to give a comprehensive overview of the most widely used supervised and unsupervised algorithms in machine learning, with practical examples and explanations.
